# Topomatik

Topomatik automatically reflects your underlying infrastructure in Kubernetes node topology annotations, because manually updating topology is about as fun as untangling holiday lights. üéÑ

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/

## ‚ú® Features

* Automagically updates the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and `topology.kubernetes.io/region` node annotations based on autodiscovered infrastructure
* Multiple auto-discovery engines. Currently only LLDP is supported (more coming soon‚Ñ¢)
* Works with both virtualized and bare-metal nodes
* Runs as a DaemonSet; updates topology even when nodes are live-migrated

## üì¶ Installation

## Configuration

## Auto-discovery engines

### LLDP

LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) is a vendor-neutral Layer 2 protocol that enables network devices to automatically discover and share information about their identity, capabilities, and neighboring devices on a local network.

It can be used in both bare-metal and virtualized environments to inform nodes about the underlying topology. In bare-metal environments, it must be enabled at the network device level (e.g., switches). In virtualized environments, you'll need to install the lldpd service on your hypervisors.

#### Proxmox PVE setup

Here is an example of installation of the `lldpd` service on your Proxmox PVEs.
